A quick little website I spent a couple hours hacking on to compare the questionable Rolling Stone list ["The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-guitarists-1234814010/) (made by human editors whose job is it to have good music opinions) with ChatGPT's (who has never heard music ever).

These days, I'm exclusively a Python developer. I don't know any Javascript, so if you read through the code and think it is bad, that checks out.
